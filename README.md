# Kaaval (കാവൽ)

Kaaval is a cross-platform security tool that does three major things:

1. Scans the downloads folder for newly downloaded files ending with specific extensions 
2. Automatically quarantines the  files so IT infrastructure is secure and for user to verify authenticity
3. Gives user option for next step with file: either trash immediately or return file to Downloads

Kaaval is designed for both Users and IT infrastructure giving users control to act on a suspicious file 
while giving IT Systems protection from suspicious files wreaking havoc immediately.

Kaaval is also intended to cause friction and delay the time for scammers and hackers from exploiting
and launching malware or gaining access to systems.
